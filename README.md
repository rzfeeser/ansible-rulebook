This solution is intentionally kept simple for the purposes of education and testing scenarios.


## Overview
Hey gang! Professor Feeser here. This repository is used to demonstrate ansible-rulebook, the core of Event Driven Ansible (EDA) within Ansible Automation Platfrom (AAP), on my [YouTube Channel @CodeWithFeeser](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithFeeser). More broadly, it contains an inventory, simple Ansible playbook, and rulebook.


## Video Demos
Videos demonstrating use of this playbook and rulebook are available on the author's [YouTube Channel @CodeWithFeeser](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithFeeser):

## How It Works
The rulebook is consumed by `ansible-rulebook` and the playbook is triggered upon receipt of an HTTP POST + json, provided the criteria defined within the `rules` section are met.
